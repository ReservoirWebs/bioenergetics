# BioEnergetics

This repository contains the combined bioenergetics and visual
foraging model used for the [GrowChinook
website](http://growchinook.fw.oregonstate.edu/). It is
packaged as a python module which may be called independently of the
GrowChinook website.

API documentation in HTML format can be found in the [doc
directory](./doc), and is hosted
[here](http://growchinook.fw.oregonstate.edu/apidocs/).

Have a look in the [unit tests](./tests) directory for example usage.
